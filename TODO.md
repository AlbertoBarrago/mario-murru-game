## Add Leaderboard with Fastify and MongoDB Atlas ðŸš€

1. Create a Form Overlay
   - Design a simple form that appears when the game ends
   - Collect the player's name before showing game over screen
   - Style it to match your game's aesthetic

2. Set Up MongoDB Atlas
   
   - Create a free MongoDB Atlas account
   - Set up a cluster and database for storing scores
   - Create proper indexes for efficient querying

3. Create Backend API
   
   - Set up a Fastify server
   - Create endpoints for saving and retrieving scores
   - Implement proper error handling and validation

4. Implement Leaderboard Display
   
   - Create a leaderboard UI to show top scores
   - Add sorting and pagination if needed
   - Style it to match your game's theme

5. Connect Frontend to Backend
   
   - Add fetch calls to submit scores
   - Implement leaderboard data retrieval
   - Handle loading states and errors

## Technical Approach
### Frontend (Vanilla JavaScript)
1. Create modal dialogs for the form and leaderboard using HTML/CSS/JS
2. Use the Fetch API to communicate with your backend
3. Implement proper form validation
4. Add event listeners for form submission

### Backend (Fastify + MongoDB)
1. Create a simple schema for player scores
2. Set up RESTful endpoints with Fastify schemas
3. Implement sorting and limiting for leaderboard queries
4. Add proper error handling and validation using Fastify hooks

## Best Practices
1. Separation of Concerns
   
   - Keep game logic separate from form/leaderboard logic
   - Use modular JavaScript functions
2. Progressive Enhancement
   
   - Make sure the game still works if the leaderboard service is down
   - Provide fallbacks for network errors
3. Security Considerations
   
   - Validate and sanitize user input using Fastify schemas
   - Use environment variables for sensitive information
   - Implement rate limiting using Fastify rate-limit plugin
4. Performance
   
   - Optimize MongoDB queries with proper indexes
   - Minimize DOM manipulations
   - Consider caching leaderboard data

## Implementation Steps
1. First, create the form HTML/CSS
2. Set up MongoDB Atlas account and get connection string
3. Create Fastify backend with necessary endpoints and schemas
4. Modify game logic to show form before game over
5. Implement score submission logic
6. Create and style the leaderboard display
7. Test the entire flow end-to-end
